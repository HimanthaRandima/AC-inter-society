        </ol>
        <h2>Scoring</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            - Each problem consists of a certain number of subtasks; therefore,
            when a competitor solves a subtask, they will obtain marks relevant
            for that subtask.
          </li>
          <li>
            - A competitorâ€™s score depends on the number of test cases their
            code successfully passes.
          </li>
          <li>
            - If a competitor submits multiple solutions for a problem, the
            highest score achieved will be counted.
          </li>
          <li>
            - A competitor&apos;s total score is the sum of the scores earned
            for each problem attempted.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Competitors are ranked by their total score. In the event of a
            tie, the time of the first correct submission of the last solved
            problem will be used to break the tie.
          </li>
          <li>- There will not be any penalty for wrong submissions.</li>
        </ol>
